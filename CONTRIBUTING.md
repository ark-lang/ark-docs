# Contributing
So you want to contribute? That's great! This file explains a few ways in which you can help, though any help is appreciated :-)
Note that this file covers contributing _exclusively_ for the documentation, if you wish to contribute to the compiler itself, check out the [contributing document](//github.com/ark-lang/ark/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a guide on contributing to the compiler.

## Writing documentation _here_
If you wish to contribute to any of the sections, send a PR! If there's a spelling mistake, typo, grammatical error, or you want to document something of your own, go for it! Any contributions are accepted with open arms and greatly appreciated.

## Writing documentation for the Standard Library
If you wish to write documentation for the standard library, you want to fork the main ark repository. Over there you'll find the standard library. There is a style guide in the `guides` directory in this repository that you should familiarize yourself with.
