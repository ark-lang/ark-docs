An if statement is denoted with the `if` keyword, followed by a condition and
a block of statements to execute.

Parenthesis are optional as they are part of the expression rather than the
statement, though it is preffered that you exclude the parenthesis in an
if statement.

```
if x == 5 && y == 10 && z == 21 {
    ...
}
```
