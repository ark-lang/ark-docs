# Interfaces
Interfaces are named collections of method signatures. In Ark, interfaces are implicit,
which means that if something has the methods defined in an interface `A`, it will
implicitly implement interface `A`. This allows for duck typing, or in
other words: "If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.".
