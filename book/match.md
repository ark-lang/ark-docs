# Match
Match is a control structure that takes an expression and will branch based
on its value. A match is denoted with the `match` keyword, followed by the
expression, and a block of conditions to check, or "arms". An arm is of the
form `val -> expr`, and must be terminated with a semi-colon. 
When the value matches the given expression, that arms expression will be 
evaluated. Note that you can either have a single expression, or you can 
insert a block and have a group of them:
    
    match x {
        1 -> ...,
        2 -> ...,
        3 -> ...,
        4 -> {
            ...;
            ...;
            ...;
        },
    }

A match must have at least one arm, this arm is "fallback" arm; i.e. when none
of the arms match the given expression, it will evaluate whatever is in
that arm. The "fallback" arm matches the pattern `_`:

    match x {
        1 -> ..., // if it' 1, do this
        _ -> ..., // do this if it's anything other than 1
    }
