# Comments
There are two types of comments in Ark:

* single line comments
* multiple line comments

However there are a few rules when commenting that you should follow.

## Single Line Comments
A single line comment is denoted with two forward slashes `//`.

```
// this is my comment
// woah, here's another one!
```
