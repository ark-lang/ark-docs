# Comments
There are two types of comments in Ark:

* single line comments
* multiple line comments

However there are a few rules when commenting that you should follow.

## Single Line Comments
A single line comment is denoted with two forward slashes `//`.

```
// this is my comment
// woah, here's another one!
```

## Multiple Line Comments
Comments that span over multiple lines are denoted with a forward slash,
followed by an asterisks, and they must be closed with an asterisks and
a backwards slash.

```
/*
    this is my comment!
*/
