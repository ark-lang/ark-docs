Welcome to the introduction for the Ark programming language! The ark programming language is a systems programming language focused on being practical and pragmatic. We want a language that is modern, easy to write, and powerful enough to create readable, performant code for any problem.

The language is currently in ongoing development, which means this introduction -- and the other documentation -- may be out of date at any given time. Though, we do strive to keep everything as up to date as possible.

This introduction will cover a variety of topics. We will not go into specific detail, if you are looking for this level of detail, check the specification.

Here's an index of what we're covering so you can jump to the parts you're interested in:
