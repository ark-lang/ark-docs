This is the official reference for the Ark programming language. Note that this
document is not final and could change at any point, as could the compiler
itself, which means that the reference could become out-dated. We try
to avoid changes that break a lot of compatibility, or involve a lot of
re-factoring in the code, or updates to the reference. Yet, considering the
stage of the compiler, it's inevitable that things will break.

This file serves as a reference to the language, and not as an introduction. If
you are familiar with other languages like C, Rust, C++, Go, ... then most of
this document should be easy to use as a cheat sheet. 

If you are a new programmer, this will probably be tricky to 
use as an introduction to the language (and programming in general). This is
because it is a reference for the language, and is more of an aid to the
developers working on it, and as a birds-eye view for people interested
in Ark.
