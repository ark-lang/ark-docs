This is the official reference for the [Ark programming language](github.com/ark-lang/ark). Note that this
document is not final and could change at any point, as could the compiler
itself, which means that the reference could become out-dated. We try
to avoid changes that break a lot of compatibility, or involve a lot of
re-factoring in the code. Yet, considering the
stage of the compiler, it's inevitable that things will break.

This file serves as a reference to the language, however it can be used as
an introduction to the language, though it is not written to be read as one. If
you are familiar with other languages like C, Rust, C++, Go, ... then most of
this document should be easy to use as a cheat sheet.
