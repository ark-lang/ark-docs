# Ark Documentation
This is the _WIP_ documentation for the Ark programming language. It serves
as a formal introduction and overview of the language, though it is not
an in-depth technical look at the internals of the compiler.

If you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, you should be able
to work through this documentation and understand how to program Ark
applications. You can find a (potentially outdated version) of the
documentation [here](//book.ark-lang.org).
