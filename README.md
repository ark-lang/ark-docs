# Ark Documentation
This is the documentation for the Ark programming language.

## Where do I start?
There are a few folders that cover different aspects of the laguage.
Here's a breakdown:

* `intro` - An introduction to the Ark language. If you are looking for a brief overview of the language, and how to get started, this is for you.
* `spec` - Covers _every_ detail of the language, this is technical documentation for the nerds. You can use it for a reference if you need to know about how something behaves, or if you need to know about an obscure feature, etc.
* `guides` - A collection of useful guides, these will help you write idiomatic Ark, and are there to ease you into concepts that may seem foreign.
* `meta` - Additional notes on the compiler itself. Anything that doesn't fall under the categories above, will likely end up here.
