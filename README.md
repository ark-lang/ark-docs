# Ark Documentation
This is the documentation for the Ark programming language. It 
serves as a formal introduction and overview of the language, 
though it is not an in-depth technical look at the internals of the 
compiler.

If you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, you should be 
able to work through this documentation and understand how to 
program Ark applications. You can find a compiled version of the documentation [here](//book.ark-lang.org).

## Before reading the docs...
Some important notes before you read this document:

* Unless otherwise noted most of these features are implemented in the compiler
* There will likely be errors in the documentation!
* Some standard library features are covered, but the standard library is still very young in development
* For simplicity, some of the code snippets aren't _completely_ accurate, i.e. constants like PI are made up, etc.
* Because the compiler is not stable, we can't guarantee that all of the examples in the documentation will compile
